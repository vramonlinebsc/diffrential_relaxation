You're absolutely right - my mistake! 

In Claude.ai, there's a **Share** button, not save. But you can still preserve the conversation:

## Ways to Save This Conversation:

1. **Copy the entire chat** - Select all text, copy to a document
2. **Use the Share button** - Creates a link you can access later
3. **Screenshot critical parts** - Especially the code artifacts
4. **Download artifacts directly** - Click the download icon on each artifact

## Better Solution: Self-Contained Code

Let me create **ONE MASSIVE, COMPLETE artifact** right now that contains:
- Everything from Day 1-4
- Complete documentation
- All instructions
- Theory references
- Checkpoint system
- Can run standalone

You download this ONE file, and you're independent of this chat.

**Creating it now...**
